Hey, I’m Jon. I started Breelabs to share my journey of starting, growing, and eventually selling my Managed Service Provider (MSP) business in 2022. Over nearly a decade, I went from running a small operation out of sheer determination to building an award-winning company that was eventually acquired. Along the way, I learned a lot—about entrepreneurship, leadership, resilience, and what it really takes to turn an idea into something real. This blog is my way of passing those lessons on.
        </p>
        <p>
When I was starting out, I would have given anything for real, unfiltered stories about what it’s like to run a business—the good days that keep you going, the bad days that make you question everything, and the moments in between that shape who you become. Most of what I found back then was either overly polished success stories or vague, one-size-fits-all advice that didn’t really prepare me for the reality. Breelabs is the blog I wish I had when I was getting started.
        </p>
        <p>
Here, I write about the wins, the failures, and the course corrections that defined my entrepreneurial path. My goal isn’t just to give you a playbook—it’s to give you perspective. I want you to see that starting a business is messy, unpredictable, and sometimes uncomfortable, but also deeply rewarding. If my stories help you avoid a few pitfalls, make better decisions, or simply feel less alone in your own journey, then I’ve done my job.
        </p>
        <p>
I believe more people should take the leap into entrepreneurship. The world needs more problem solvers, more creators, and more people willing to put their ideas into motion. It’s not easy—nothing worth doing ever is—but it’s worth it. If reading about my experiences gives you the spark to take that first step, then Breelabs has served its purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
I’ve seen firsthand how one small decision can change the entire course of your life. For me, it was choosing to bet on myself and start something of my own, even when I didn’t have all the answers. That single choice opened doors, created opportunities, and taught me lessons I never would have learned otherwise. I want to help others see that you don’t have to have everything figured out—you just have to start.
        </p>

So grab a coffee, read a few posts, and see if something here inspires you to step into the arena. Your story might be the next one worth telling.
